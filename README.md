## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create toggle elements using Vanilla Javascript using some primitive logic.
I don't feel very proud of CSS in this and  found that there is a major scope for learning and improvement especially
about Mobile first Workflow and Responsive design.

### Continued development

- Make the design pixel perfect
- Work on the Hamburger Menu and implement sliding menu
- Make CSS more compact and reduce the lines of code
- Right now there are about 7 Media Queries varying with respect to different widths, but I wish to make them
  as los as possible as I continue learning more about CSS.
- Implementation of the same Landing Page using React 

### Useful resources

- [Dropdown Menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp) - This helped me with toggle different elements. 

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article/cheatsheet for Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

This was a really good challenge and I really enjoyed doing it. I got to know and implement many interesting things along with
my weakpoints on which I really need to work on along with brushing up the already strong points.
